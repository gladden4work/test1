This repository contains a random password generator that can be used from the
command line or in the browser.

## Command line usage

Run the `password_generator.py` script and follow the prompts to choose the
password length (6â€“128) and which character types to include.

```bash
python3 password_generator.py
```

## Web usage

length, character types and copy the result to your clipboard. If you prefer to
